Setup/Installation Requirements
Clone this repository to your desktop.
Open a new tab, drag the HTML document into the blank search bar and hit enter.
Known Bugs
JS and CSS won't register when the html doc is dragged into an empty tab's url bar. This is due to the scripts.js and styles.css files being placed in their respective folders. Using a live server in vscode gets the webpage to register them but that doesn't fix the issue. So for the time being, the files remain outside their respective css and js folders.
